3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process that creates three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer based on a digital design. This technology has transformed industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and aerospace, offering greater customization, efficiency, and reduced waste compared to traditional production methods. Materials used in 3D printing include plastics, metals, ceramics, and even biological materials, making it a versatile tool for producing prototypes, intricate components, or even functional parts. With continued advancements, 3D printing is becoming more accessible and affordable, enabling smaller businesses and individuals to harness its potential.

In addition to industrial applications, 3D printing has made significant strides in sectors such as medicine and construction. In healthcare, for example, custom prosthetics, dental implants, and even bioprinted tissues are being developed to offer patient-specific solutions. In construction, large-scale 3D printers are being used to build homes and infrastructure, reducing material waste and labor costs. The flexibility and rapid production capabilities of 3D printing are revolutionizing how products are designed and manufactured, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation across various fields.

### 3D Printers

3D printers are machines with moving parts that will inevitably wear out. The parts that
wear out are not easy to produce with other machine tools. The 3D printer needs to be
maintained by it's owner who is forced to order new parts. The parts need to be
provided by the 3D printer manufacturing company along with customer service that
provides additional help or guidance. 

Most 3D printer owners are hobbyists and spend under $500 CDN on their first 3D
printer(s). Professional 3D printer owners spend more on their 3D printer and they will
order spare parts in advance. 

Chinese 3D printers are inexpensive for North American buyers and also Chinese
manufacturers. These 3D printers have flooded the marketplaces and are purchased
more often than American 3D printers. 

In any method maintaining a 3D printer as a hobby and/or a profession is a lot of work. 
Determining if you are a professional or hobbyist is difficult and complicates the initial
decision to buy a 3D printer.

### 3D Printer Filament

Polymaker is the best brand and they have a wide selection of colours. Polylactic acid (PLA) thermoplastic is the most popular are most available plastic 3D printer filament. Sourceduty uses Polymaker Polyterra Matte PLA 1.75 filament for 95% of it’s 3D prints. Polyterra is very strong, rich coloured and can be tied into a knot because it’s very malleable.

Notes:

- Most thermoplastic filament imported from China is very low quality just like Chinese 3D printers. 
- Higher printing temperatures require a 3D printer enclosure.
- Most clear or transparent 3D printer filament doesn’t adhere to build plates or itself very well.
- Plastic filament storage spools should be banned.
- Biodegradable 3D printer filament should be sold in stores now and not in the future.
- Glow in the dark filaments are very abrasive and wear down 3D printer nozzles quicker than normal.

### Future 3D Printer Plastic Ideas

1. Stress indicating 3D printer plastic.
2. X-ray indication 3D printer plastic.
3. Chemical indication 3D printer plastic.
4. Stress protection 3D printer plastic.
5. Dynamic biodegradable age, stress, and heat indicating 3D printer plastic.

Plastic Properties:
- Plastic could indicate material dynamics with different colors, useful for measuring stress or fatigue caused by tension, compression, and torsion in 3D printed models.

Color-changing Properties:
- Plastic could be formed into products with a base color that slowly fades through other colors like bronze, silver, and gold over time.
- Every 2, 5, or 10 years, the plastic changes color to indicate its age.

Potential Applications:
- Vehicle tires could change color when they are too old and stressed.

### 3D Printed Food

Food 3D printing is an innovative technology that uses edible materials to create customized, intricate food designs layer by layer. Ingredients such as chocolate, dough, and purees are extruded through a nozzle, similar to how traditional 3D printers work with plastic. This method offers the potential for producing tailored nutritional meals, as users can control the exact ingredients and portion sizes. It has found applications in creating visually appealing food, personalized meals for dietary restrictions, and even food for astronauts or in extreme environments.

### 3D Printed Ice Cream

Ice 3D printing, on the other hand, involves using water as the primary material, freezing it layer by layer to form complex structures. While still an emerging field, ice 3D printing has potential applications in art installations, architecture, and environmental research. The process requires careful temperature control to ensure that the ice solidifies before additional layers are added, preventing melting or collapsing. Ice printing is also being explored as a sustainable building material for temporary structures or experiments in cold environments like Antarctica, where the use of ice is abundant and practical.
