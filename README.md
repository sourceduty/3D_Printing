A decentralized marketplace for 3D model assets is a platform where creators, buyers, and sellers of digital 3D models can exchange assets without the need for a centralized authority or intermediary. Unlike traditional marketplaces that are managed by a central entity, decentralized marketplaces are built on blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, allowing users to directly interact and trade with one another. These platforms operate using smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements on the blockchain that ensure transactions are secure, transparent, and automatic. The use of cryptocurrency is often a core part of these platforms, enabling global transactions without the friction of traditional payment systems.

In decentralized 3D asset marketplaces, creators can upload their models, set their own prices, and retain more control over their intellectual property. The decentralized nature of the platform ensures that no single entity can censor or restrict the sale or distribution of these assets. Moreover, artists can earn revenue without the hefty fees often associated with centralized platforms, which typically take a percentage of each sale. Some decentralized marketplaces also offer mechanisms for artists to tokenize their 3D models as NFTs (non-fungible tokens), providing unique ownership and provenance of digital creations.

Buyers benefit from the transparency and security that decentralized platforms provide, as transactions and ownership records are publicly available on the blockchain. This system reduces the risks of fraud, ensuring that the buyer is purchasing a legitimate asset directly from the creator. The decentralized model also offers a more open and diverse marketplace, as anyone from anywhere in the world can participate without needing to rely on traditional gatekeepers or payment systems.

Overall, decentralized marketplaces for 3D model assets empower creators and buyers by removing intermediaries, reducing costs, and offering enhanced transparency and security through blockchain technology. Examples of these platforms may include options built on blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum or Solana, though the field is still emerging and growing in adoption.

### 3D Printers

![3D Printers](https://github.com/sourceduty/3D_Printing/assets/123030236/76c676a4-aae3-4d84-a06b-661ca207b53c)

3D printers are machines with moving parts that will inevitably wear out. The parts that
wear out are not easy to produce with other machine tools. The 3D printer needs to be
maintained by it's owner who is forced to order new parts. The parts need to be
provided by the 3D printer manufacturing company along with customer service that
provides additional help or guidance. 

Most 3D printer owners are hobbyists and spend under $500 CDN on their first 3D
printer(s). Professional 3D printer owners spend more on their 3D printer and they will
order spare parts in advance. 

Chinese 3D printers are inexpensive for North American buyers and also Chinese
manufacturers. These 3D printers have flooded the marketplaces and are purchased
more often than American 3D printers. 

In any method maintaining a 3D printer as a hobby and/or a profession is a lot of work. 
Determining if you are a professional or hobbyist is difficult and complicates the initial
decision to buy a 3D printer.
